## Information

Run script `build_and_package_installer.ps1` to build the Tauri project and then get a .zip containing the installation file.


**NOTE:**
New for version 1.1.0 - We are now packaging ffmpeg with OSVC in order to mitigate any configuration issues when doing the ffmpeg installation separately.
